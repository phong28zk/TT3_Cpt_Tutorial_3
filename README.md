# Tutorial 3 - Computer Programming

## Introduction

* The title of this tutorial is find mean and variance using header files and function overloading. In this tutorial, we will learn how to use the functions defined in the header file in our program. And this is the topic from our teacher 'Nguyen Trung Anh'

* With this topic, my group create 4 files in this repository to solve.
The "Readme.MD" is this file, describe all other files.
The first file is "Tuto3.cpp", it contains the main function.
The second file is "statistics.cpp", which includes the function declaration
The third file is "statistics.h", this file defines all function my group use in this topic.

And after this intro, we go to the project with the first part - "Mean and Variance"

## Mean and Variance

* Mean
About mean, mean is a mathematical term, that describes the average of a sample. In statistics, the definition of the mean is similar to the average where it is the sum of all the given data values divided by the total number of data values given in the set. A mean is calculated for those sets of values with either more difference or those values that are close to each other. Mean has other forms as well such as the harmonic mean and geometric mean that are used in different situations.
* Variance
The term variance refers to a statistical measurement of the spread between numbers in a data set. More specifically, variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean (average), and thus from every other number in the set. Variance is often depicted by this symbol: σ2. It is used by both analysts and traders to determine volatility and market security.
The square root of the variance is the standard deviation (SD or σ), which helps determine the consistency of an investment’s returns over a period of time.

## Build/Run this project
* Open the terminal and run the following commands ( for Windows )
> git clone https://github.com/Leon28Phongretzka/TT3_Cpt_Tutorial_3.git

> cd TT3_Cpt_Tutorial_3

> g++ Tuto3.cpp -o Tuto3.exe

> Tuto3.exe

* If the following commands can't run, you can download the extension from Visual Studio Code, it called "CPH ( Competitive Programming Helper )" and run "Tuto3.cpp". You can claim the result after this.
